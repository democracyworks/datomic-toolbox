# datomic-toolbox

Datomic utility library

Requires a config.edn file in the classpath with 
`{:datomic {:uri XXX :partition :XXX}}`

## Migrations

Datomic Toolbox has support for migrations. The database needs to be initialized by datomic-toolbox to get this support (older databases will need to be migrated). Running `(initialize)` installs the partition and a transaction attribute called :datomic-toolbox/migration, which is used to keep track of which migration files have been run.

Files in resources/schema that end in .edn are considered migration files. datomic-toolbox orders schema files lexigraphically, so the convention is to name them with a date and time followed by some text describing what they do, e.g. "20140616105400-initial-schema.edn".

When `(run-migrations)` is called, it compares the schema files and the :datomic-toolbox/migration transaction attribute to figure out which schema files have not been run, and then runs them in ascending lexigraphical order. When a migration file is run, the transaction is tagged with the migration attribute that contains the name of that schema file. You can use `(applied-migrations)` to get the migration filenames that have been run, and `(unapplied-migrations)` to get the migration files that have not been run.

There is currently no support for automatic migration running other than when `(initialize)` is first called, at which time it will run all available migrations. Outside of that, you'll need to make a call to `(run-migrations)` at the appropriate point in your application.
