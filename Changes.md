* Changes between 1.0.0 and HEAD
    * Added a core namespace. Code using this library will need to update
    require and use statements to refer to `datomic-toolbox.core`.
    **This is a breaking change.**
    * Updated to Clojure 1.7.0.
    * Updated to turbovote.resource-config 0.2.0. If you use both this and
    resource-config, **then this is a breaking change for you.** You will
    need to update to resource-config 0.2.0+ as well.
