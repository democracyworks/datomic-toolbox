# datomic-toolbox

Datomic utility library

Takes a config map like:
`{:uri XXX :partition :XXX}`

Pass it in like this `(datomic-toolbox.core/initialize config-map)` or
like this `(datomic-toolbox.core/configure! config-map)` before using
any of the zero-arity stateful fns.

## Migrations

Datomic Toolbox has support for migrations. The database needs to be initialized by datomic-toolbox to get this support (older databases will need to be migrated). Running `(initialize config-map)` installs the partition and a transaction attribute called :datomic-toolbox/migration, which is used to keep track of which migration files have been run.

Files in resources/schema that end in .edn are considered migration files. datomic-toolbox orders schema files lexigraphically, so the convention is to name them with a date and time followed by some text describing what they do, e.g. "20140616105400-initial-schema.edn".

When `(run-migrations)` is called, it compares the schema files and the :datomic-toolbox/migration transaction attribute to figure out which schema files have not been run, and then runs them in ascending lexigraphical order. When a migration file is run, the transaction is tagged with the migration attribute that contains the name of that schema file. You can use `(applied-migrations)` to get the migration filenames that have been run, and `(unapplied-migrations)` to get the migration files that have not been run.

There is currently no support for automatic migration running other than when `(initialize config-map)` is first called, at which time it will run all available migrations. Outside of that, you'll need to make a call to `(run-migrations)` at the appropriate point in your application.

## Transactions

When you need atomic transactions we have `with-retry-tx` that treats Datomic like an atom. For example:

```clojure
(db/with-retry-tx
  @(db/transact
    [ ;; assert same subscription
     [:assert-not-empty
      '{:find [?subid]
        :in [$ ?subid ?userid]
        :where [[?subid :user/id ?userid]]}
      id user-id]
     ;; assert it hasn't changed
     [:assert-equal
      (set current-mediums)
      id :notification/medium]
     ;; retract the entity
     [:db.fn/retractEntity id]]])
```

If the value of the `current-mediums` changes mid-transaction this
code won't throw an exception, rather it will try and run the logic
again up to 100 times. This treats Datomic more like an atom.

### Transaction Functions

`:transact`

Generally useful for setting values of all types and cardinalities using compare-and-swap semantics.

`:assert-empty`

Generally useful for asserting that something still doesn't exist. For instance, assuring the uniqueness of a particular entity. See election-notification-works, where we want at most one subscription per user.

`:assert-not-empty`

Similarly useful for assuring that something still exists.

`:assert-equal`

Assert that a constant value is equal to the value of an entities property.
